Pronounciation of Haohe: <span style="font-family: &quot;Doulos SIL&quot;, sans-serif; font-style: italic;">|hɑʊ'hə|</span> (the same "he" as "hello")


{% include image.html url="images/longmen.jpg" caption="" width="190px" align="right" %}

I’m Haohe Liu, a second-year Ph.D. student at the [Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing] (CVSSP), University of Surrey. My research includes topics related to speech, music, and general audio. Most of my studies are open-sourced. Currently, I'm working on text-to-general-audio generation, with more emphasis on better quality, controllability, immersivity, and text relevancy.

At the University of Surrey, I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mark D. Plumbley], co-supervised by [Prof. Wenwu Wang]. And I’m lucky to be jointly funded by [BBC R&D] and the Doctoral College. In the CVSSP, I’m working as part of the [AI for Sound] project with the goal of developing new methods for automatic labeling of sound environments and events in broadcast audio, assisting production staff to find and search through content, and helping the general public access archive content. I’m also working closely with BBC R&D Audio Team on putting our audio recognition algorithms into production, such as generating machine tags in [BBC sound effect library].

**I'm open to research and cooperations on related topics. Feel free to drop me an email.**
