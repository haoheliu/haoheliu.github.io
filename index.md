I’m Haohe Liu, a PhD student at the [Centre for Vision Speech and Signal Processing] (CVSSP), University of Surrey. My research includes topics related to speech, music, and general audio. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mark D. Plumbley], co-supervised by [Prof. Wenwu Wang]. And I’m lucky to be jointly funded by [BBC R&D] and the Doctoral College. I'm a team member of the EPSRC [AI for Sound] Project (EP/T019751/1). Most of my studies are open-sourced. 

<!-- In the CVSSP, I’m working as part of the [AI for Sound] project to develop new methods for automatic labelling of sound environments and events in broadcast audio, assisting production staff in finding and searching through content and helping the general public access archive content.  -->
<!-- I’m also working closely with BBC R&D Audio Team on putting our audio recognition algorithms into production, such as generating machine tags in [BBC sound effect library]. -->

## Research highlights
My research includes tasks related to the audio generative model, source separation, quality enhancement, and recognition, appeared in journals and conferences such as TPAMI, TASLP, ICML, AAAI, NeurIPS, INTERSPEECH, and ICASSP.

Highlighted research performed as the first author:

- Text-to-audio generation model: [AudioLDM] and [AudioLDM2].
- Ultra-low bitrate audio codec: [Semanticodec]
- Audio super-resolution model on any audio type and any sampling rate: [AudioSR].
- First text-to-speech model that achieves on par CMOS with human recording: [NaturalSpeech].
- Restore the quality of human speech signal regardless of how the signal is degraded: [VoiceFixer].
- The music source separation system that achieves leading performance on Music Demixing Challenge 2021: [CWS-PResUNet].
